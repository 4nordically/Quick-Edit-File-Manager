# 📁 Que: Folder Management
Que (Quick Edit) Uses python to manage files easily, delete bulk files, rename entire folders, and loads more!

## ❓ How to use
Simply, download the quickedit.py file, and open it using Python.
Enter the following: "python quickedit.py"
(Note, if you rename the file, you would run this: "python {file_name}.py)

Once it runs, it will open a simple prompt based system where you will respond with A, B, or C.
Make sure to enter the full folder name cd:example/example/folder - NOT just the folder name!

Runs locally, so it's safe and secure. Feel free to review the code at your own leisure.
